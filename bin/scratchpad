#!/bin/sh
#    implements a toggling scratchpad xterm.  Not quite as useful as
#    the official xmonad one, since it gets killed to make it go away.
#    However, it can be run under any window manager, which could be
#    useful.  History is kept in .bash_history_scratchpad.

export WS=scratchpad
