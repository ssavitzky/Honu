### Backups
#   This is obsolete; backups are now done with cron on nova only.
#   We could, however, use it to keep a secondary mirror up to date.

    # It's done in idle because we need ssh for nova's root partition
    #
    if [ -d /mirror ] && [ -x /usr/local/sbin/daily-mirror ] && $sshOK; then
	ssh -x root@localhost /usr/local/sbin/daily-mirror -v < /dev/null
    fi

    # Do git pushes.  Use make push.  Private needs to be pushed from nova
