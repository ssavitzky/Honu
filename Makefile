### If we're using the Tools package, chain in its Makefile
#	This is optional -- it doesn't affect basic functionality -- but it
#	brings in a lot of useful extras like "make push", recursive "make all",
#	and so on.  Note that include does the right thing if the file list is
#	empty, so we don't have to test for that.
#
#	Normally Makefile is a symlink, and local dependencies go into
#	depends.make; I decided to try something different this time.

### report-vars
#	report-vars is also defined in the Tools package, so you can use it to
#	see whether Tools/Makefile is properly chained in.
