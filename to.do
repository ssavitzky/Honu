o Some dotfiles, e.g. .gitconfig, really need to be modified by a script rather than
  simply symlinked.  That's because things like username and email address change from one
  system to another.  So use a file full of, e.g., git config --global ...  An alternative
  would be to include them.
  
o regular dotfiles should start with "_" rather than ".", to make them visible.
