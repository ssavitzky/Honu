# jackrc-version:31

# Global jackrc file for Debian, documenting some of the most important
# options. The default options are commented out.

# You can copy this to ~/.jack3rc and customize it youself. But beware,
# the syntax is not trivial and might result in errors.

# The preferred way to set options is to add --save to the command-line,
# which sets the respective option in your ~/.jack3rc.

# The directory where jack puts the files by default.
# This defaults to the current directory if unset:
base_dir:/home/steve/vv/mm/audio

# The default ripper. You can choose from 'cdparanoia'(default), 'cdda2wav',
# 'tosha' or 'dagrab' (The last two are not avaiable in Debian).
ripper:cdparanoia

# The default encoder. You can choose from 'oggenc'(default), 'flac', 'xing',
# 'mppenc', 'lame', 'l3enc', 'gogo', 'mp3enc' or (only oggenc and flac are
# available in Debian).
encoder:oggenc

# The VBR-quality of the encoded OGGs. -1 is lowest, 10 is highest.

# rename_fmt specifies how the resulting files are named:
#   %n: track number
#   %a: artist
#   %t: track title
#   %l: album title
#   %y: album release year - individual track years are unsupported
#   %g: album genre - individual track genres are unsupported
#rename_fmt:%a/%l/%n-%t   # "Artist/Album/01-Tracktitle.[ext]"
rename_fmt:%n-%t # "01-Tracktitle.[ext]"
unusable_chars:[' ', '/']
replacement_chars:['_', '_']

# be less demanding about various artists
freedb_pedantic:0

# If this is set, always query freedb when starting to rip a CD.
# By default, jack does not query freedb
query_on_start

# If this is set, continue work even if the freedb-query failed.
# By default, jack stops with an error
#cont_failed_query

# server to use -- freedb is mostly abandoned
